        I am a fluent speaker of (egyptian) Arabic, been speaking it since I was
        a child. I think it's a very enjoyable language but I need to improve
        writing and reading.
      </div>

      <div class="english">
        I am a fluent speaker of English as well, since I'm born and raised in
        America. It's alright, but not the most fun language.

        I am learning Japanese at the moment, it's a very interesting language
        but also very tough. I know about a hundred Kanji, but the grammar and
        vocabulary is difficult and rewarding.

      <div class="french">
        I am a very beginner french speaker, but I think it's a super fun
        language to learn as well very fun to speak. I definitely want to invest
        more time to learning this one soon.
